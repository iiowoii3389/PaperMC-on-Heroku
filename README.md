<h1> Server Optimizations </h1>

All optimizations have already been done!

View them here - https://github.com/iiowoii/PaperMC-on-Heroku/tree/master/opt/panel/serverbase

<h1> Notice </h1>

The total ram of a free dyno is limited to 512 mb.<br>
When the ram usage is more than 512 mb, it will reset.<br>
The file manager upload is only intended to be used for small plugins etc.<br>
When a file takes more than 30 seconds to upload it will result in heroku blocking it.
